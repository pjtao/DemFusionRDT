This project is the C++ implementation of the DEM fusion method proposed in the paper "A Simple Adaptive DEM Void Filling Method
Based on Raster Distance Transform" published in GRSL.

1. All source code is located in the DemFusionRDT folder, of which dem_fusion_distance_transform.cpp is the core code file.
   The compiled executable program is located in the Bin folder.
2. The sample_data folder contains sample data, among which
   (a) dsm_with_voids_10m_large.tif and dsm_with_voids_10m_small.tif are DEM files with void areas to be filled,
   (b) referece_srtm_30m.tif is the auxiliary DEM file.
